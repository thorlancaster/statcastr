This folder contains classes that:
    1: Extend UIPanel
    2: Deal with RAW HTML ELEMENTS
    3: Don't contain any sub-objects

Classes that violate (2) AND (3) belong in Components.
Classes that violate (3) but not (2) don't belong anywhere.
    In this case, the HTML-managing code belongs in its own class.
